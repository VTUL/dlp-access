<h2>Virginia Tech Digital Libraries</h2>

    As part of Virginia Tech University Libraries (VTUL) mission as a global land-grant university by providing access to a plethora of resources in varying disciplines, we collect, develop, and support a wide variety of digital collections.  This site brings together some of those digital collections to meet our organizational vision:

    We aspire to transform the way people experience knowledge. We do this by providing new ways to discover, access, create, sustain, and share information. The Libraries aim to advance learning and research by enabling new types of questions to be asked, new forms of scholarship to be produced, and previously unimaginable problems or solutions to be explored.

<h2>Mapping</h2>

<p>
    Including maps in a digital repository provides valuable context and visualization for geographic data, enhancing understanding and analysis. 
    Maps offer users a spatial perspective, allowing them to explore relationships, patterns, and trends within the data more intuitively. 
    Additionally, maps facilitate collaboration and decision-making by providing a common visual reference point for stakeholders across various domains.
